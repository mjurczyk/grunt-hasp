# ![grunt](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1630826?v=3&s=40) Hasp Grunt task

Run [Hasp](https://github.com/djanowski/hasp) precompiler in your Grunt pipeline.

Task is minimalistic and provides no options at the moment.

Example of how to use it is stored in `example/` directory. Example translates `.hcss` files from `input/` to `output/`, also minifying them on the way (functionality not included in the plugin).

To run the example, clone repository and run:

```shell
npm test
```
